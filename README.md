# Shopify Challenge - Backend Image Repository

## Getting Started

1. In the root folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` in the root folder to start the server

### Notes:

- For this project, it's best to commit your changes from the root folder as the husky pre-commit hook will automatically run and lint/format your files
- Every time you update the graphql schema, you will need to `npm run generate:types`. The server should be running in a separate terminal to do this
